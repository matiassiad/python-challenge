PyBank 

In this Challenge, create a Python script to analyze the company's financial records. Use financial data set named Budget_data.csv. The data set consists of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Loss".

The Python script parses the logs to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the data set.

The total net amount of "Profit/Loss" for the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Loss" over the entire period and then the average of those changes.

The largest profit increase (date and amount) during the entire period.

The largest decrease in profits (date and amount) during the entire period.

During the creation of the code, doubts arose, such as how to put the number of decimal places and show dates with a specific mmm-yy format, which were cleared up at https://www.python.org/ and https://realpython.com /

PyPoll 

In my opinion, this Challenge was less difficult for me to do because it is similar to the previous one and I had already clarified my doubts.

The code analysis contains the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast.

A complete list of candidates who received votes.

The percentage of votes that each candidate obtained.

The total number of votes each candidate obtained.

The winner of the elections by popular vote.
